# pothole-prediction-in-Chicago

Description
Part of the Chicago Department of Transportationâ€™s job is to fill potholes in city streets. To do this, they rely on city residents reporting potholes to the 311 system, which keeps track of all the reported pothole locations as well as the status of repairs. It is important to predict the future pothole reporting trend, so the work can be prepared in advance.

Task
We phave the pothole data that lists every report of a pothole to the city between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. We hvae to predict the total number of potholes of each month and each community area during January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. Specifically, if a report is created in a month, then the total number of potholes of that month should add the n_potholes_on_block of that report.

Hint
Winter weather damages streets. When the streets thaw out each spring, that damage turns into potholes. Therefore, we see more reports in the spring than other times of year. Some winters are more mild or harsh than other winters. 2014 was one of the worst winters on record, and we see many more pothole reports that year.
